=============================
       Linux, OS-X, BSD
=============================

Start by executing:
./bootstrap

To install add-ons into /path/to/XBMC:
./configure --prefix=/path/to/XBMC
make install

To build all PVR add-ons as .zip archives:
./configure
make zip

=============================
           Windows
=============================
Building the pvr addons standalone:
-----------------------------------
Prepare:
1) Install Visual C++ Express 2010 (follow the instructions on the wiki for XBMC itself)
Compile:
2) Open this solution from project\VS2010Express\xbmc-pvr-addons.sln
3) Select the wanted configuration "Debug" or "Release"
4) Press F7 to build the solution
Install:
Still a TODO. The buildsystem does not yet generate .zip archives
Workaround: copy the wanted pvr addons to your XBMC installation by hand.
Example: addons\pvr.demo\addon\*.* => YOUR_XBMC_DIR\addons\pvr.demo\*.*

Building the pvr addons together with xbmc:
-------------------------------------------
TODO
describe how to import the "xbmc-pvr-addons.sln" in "XBMC for Windows.sln"

XBMC Windows installer with included pvr addons:
------------------------------------------------
Not yet possible. Still a TODO.
